# Koii

The aim of the Koii network is to provide a convenient and simple way for software developers to easily concieve, implement, and deploy new mechanisms, while also enriching the public commons.

Koii provides a suite of software tools designed to:

1. Reward attention-based contributions, such as art and public data sets;
2. Reliably track and reward repeatable tasks;
3. Establish incentives and markets to reward profitable shifts in behaviour of (1) or (2).
